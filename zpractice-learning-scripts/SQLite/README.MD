# SQLite Tutorial: Introduction and Setup Guide

## What is SQLite?

SQLite is a lightweight, self-contained, and serverless database engine. Unlike other relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite does not require a separate server process, making it an ideal choice for applications that need an embedded database.

### **Key Features of SQLite:**
- **Serverless:** No need to install and run a separate database server.
- **Zero Configuration:** No setup or administration required.
- **Lightweight:** Uses minimal resources and is ideal for mobile and embedded applications.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
- **ACID-Compliant:** Supports transactions with atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.

## How to Set Up SQLite

### **Step 1: Verify SQLite Installation**
SQLite comes pre-installed on macOS. To check if it is available, open **Terminal** and run:

```sh
sqlite3 --version
```

If SQLite is installed, this will display the installed version number.

### **Step 2: Using SQLite**
Since SQLite is already installed, you can start using it immediately.
```sh
sqlite3 
```

#### **Creating a New Database**
To create and open a database, run:

```sh
sqlite3 mydatabase.db
```

If `mydatabase.db` does not exist, SQLite will create it automatically.

#### **Creating a Table**
Once inside the SQLite shell, you can create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```
If mydatabase.db does not exist, SQLite will create it automatically. This database file will persist on disk and can be reopened later for further use.

#### **Creating a Temporary In-Memory Database**

If you only need a temporary database that disappears when closed, use:

```sh
sqlite3 :memory:
```
This creates an in-memory database that exists only during the session.

#### **Inserting Data**
To add records:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com');
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Bob', 'bob@example.com');
```

#### **Querying Data**
To retrieve all records:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

#### **Exiting SQLite**
Type `.exit` or press **Ctrl + D**.


## Understanding SQLite Persistence

Unlike in-memory databases, SQLite ensures persistent storage when using a .db file. This means that the data remains saved even after the database connection is closed or the system is restarted. SQLite stores data in a single .db file, which contains all tables, indexes, and data.

To check where your database file is stored, use the following command inside the SQLite
shell:

```sql
PRAGMA database_list;
```
This will display the file path of the SQLite database currently in use.

#### Backup Consideration
If you delete the database file manually, all data will be lost permanently. Always back up your .db file if needed.

## Conclusion
You have now verified and started using SQLite on macOS! Itâ€™s an excellent choice for lightweight applications and quick database prototyping. Try exploring SQLite further by using SQL commands, integrating it with Python, or using GUI tools like **DB Browser for SQLite**.
