# How a Flask Backend Works When You Navigate to a URL

1. **App Initialization:**  
   Flask creates an application instance (using `Flask(__name__)`) which serves as the central object handling all incoming HTTP requests.

2. **Route Definition:**  
   You define routes using decorators (e.g., `@app.route('/api/message')`). Each route is associated with a function (a view function) that specifies what to do when that URL is accessed.

3. **Handling a Request:**  
   When you enter a URL (for example, `https://yourdomain.com/api/message`) in your browser, Flask matches this URL to the corresponding route. It then executes the associated view function.

4. **Response Delivery:**  
   The view function processes the request—often fetching data, performing some logic, or simply returning a value—and then sends back a response (commonly in JSON format using `jsonify`).

5. **Cross-Origin Requests (Optional):**  
   If you’re working with a frontend (like React) hosted on a different domain, extensions like Flask-CORS handle cross-origin requests, ensuring the browser can safely fetch the data.

**In summary**, Flask listens for incoming requests, matches each request to a predefined route, executes the associated logic, and sends the result back to your browser, allowing you to see the returned value when you visit that URL.
