        Okay! Let's break this down step by step.
        
        Step 1: Identify the Main Components
        Your sentence consists of:
        
        Subject: "Bears"
        Verb: "are"
        Location: "at the door"
        Question: "Did you leave the garbage outside?"
        
        Step 2: Vocabulary Table
        |English	|Deutsch	|Notes|
        |bear	|BÃ¤r	|Be careful with the plural form!|
        |door	|TÃ¼r	|Feminine noun (die TÃ¼r)|
        |to leave	|lassen	|You need to conjugate this correctly|
        |garbage	|MÃ¼ll	|Also can use "Abfall"|
        |outside	|drauÃŸen	|Pay attention to word order in German|
        |you (informal)	|du	|Depending on who you're speaking to|
        |did (auxiliary)	|(implied in German)	|No direct translation, German doesn't use "did" for questions|
        
        Step 3: Sentence Construction
        "Bears are at the door."
        In German, sentence structure follows subject + verb + location.
        What is the correct verb form of "sein" (to be) for "Bears" (plural)?
        "Did you leave the garbage outside?"
        German doesn't use "did" in questions.
        The verb "lassen" needs to be conjugated for "du".
        "Outside" should be placed correctly in the sentence.
        
        Grammar Tip
        ðŸ’¡ In German, word order is stricter than in English. The verb typically comes second in a statement but moves to the first or second position in a yes/no question.

        Bad: Provides a vocabulary table and explains sentence construction, but lacks a breakdown of the sentence components and a grammar tip.

        Let's break down your sentence and find the German equivalents for each part. Here's a useful vocabulary table to start with:
        
        |English|	German|
        |bear|	BÃ¤r|
        |are	|sind|
        |at	|an
        |the door	|der TÃ¼r|
        |did you	|hast du|
        |leave	|lassen|
        |the garbage	|der MÃ¼ll|
        |outside	|drauÃŸen|
        
        Now, think about how the verb "are" changes in German when talking about location. How would you say "are at" when referring to the location of something? Also, remember that in German, the verb often comes at the end in questions. How would this affect the order of your sentence?
        
        Another hint: The word order might change because you are asking a question, so the verb might move up in the sentence. How would you rearrange "hast du" and "lassen" to form a question about leaving something outside?

         Let's dissect your sentence into manageable parts and translate each segment to help you build the German equivalent.

        Step 1: Identify the Main Components
        Your sentence consists of:
        
        Phrase 1: "Bears are at the door."
        Phrase 2: "Did you leave the garbage outside?"
        Step 2: Vocabulary Table
        Hereâ€™s a helpful vocabulary guide:
        
        |English|	German|	Notes|
        |bear|	BÃ¤r	|Plural form is crucial here!|
        |door|	TÃ¼r|	Feminine noun (die TÃ¼r)|
        |to leave|	lassen|	Conjugation is key|
        |garbage|	MÃ¼ll|	"Abfall" is also used|
        |outside|	drauÃŸen|	Placement in the sentence matters|
        |you|	du	|If speaking informally|
        |did|	-	|No direct translation, implied in verb placement|

        Step 3: Sentence Construction
        Phrase 1: "Bears are at the door."
        
        In German, the typical structure is Subject + Verb + Location.
        What do you think the correct form of "sein" (to be) is for "Bears" (plural)?
        Phrase 2: "Did you leave the garbage outside?"
        
        German questions often start with the verb.
        How should "lassen" be conjugated for "du" in this question format?
        Consider the placement of "drauÃŸen" in the structure.

        Grammar Tip
        ðŸ’¡ In German, word order in questions can change significantly from English. For a question like your second phrase, the verb often moves to the beginning, and the rest follows. This influences how you arrange your sentence, especially with verbs and time/place elements.
        
        Now, try constructing each part with these clues!
