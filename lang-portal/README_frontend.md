# How to Run Your React (Vite) Project


### 1 Install Dependencies
- Ensure you’re in the root folder of the project (the same folder that contains `package.json`).  
- Run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2 Start the Development Server

Once dependencies are installed, start your project using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you should see output similar to:

```bash
VITE vX.X.X  ready in XX ms
➜  Local: http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

Open the provided URL (http://localhost:5173/) in your browser to view the application.

### 3. Running a Production Build

When you’re ready to deploy your app, follow these steps to build and preview a production-ready version:

- Build the App: Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command creates an optimized production build in a folder typically named dist.

- Preview the Production Build: To locally preview the production build, run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Vite will start a server that serves the contents of the dist folder, simulating a production environment.

3.3 Deploying the Production Build
	•	The content s of the dist folder are static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) that can be deployed to any static file server or hosting platform such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

### About Vite

Vite is a fast build tool and development server optimized for modern web projects, particularly for frameworks like React. Here’s what you need to know:   
	•	Lightning Fast Startup: Vite leverages native ES modules, eliminating the need for bundling during development. This results in near-instant startup times.   
	•	Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Code changes are applied instantly without needing a full page reload, making the development process more efficient.   
	•	Optimized Build Process: When you build your project for production, Vite uses Rollup under the hood to bundle and optimize your code, resulting in fast and efficient production builds.   
	•	Easy Configuration: You can customize Vite’s behavior through a configuration file (vite.config.ts or vite.config.js), which allows you to adjust settings such as plugins, server options, and build options.

# Frontend-Backend Integration Overview

Your frontend is tightly integrated with your backend through a dedicated API service layer, primarily defined in your `src/services/api.ts` file. Below is a detailed breakdown of how the connection is designed and how each component functions.


## 📌 API Service Layer (`src/services/api.ts`)

### 🔧 HTTP Client Setup
- This file likely sets up an HTTP client using either the native `fetch` API or a library such as **Axios**.
- It defines a **base URL**, usually derived from **environment variables** (configured in `vite.config.ts` or similar).
- This ensures that API requests are directed to the correct backend server.

### 🌐 Endpoint Functions
- The file contains functions that encapsulate HTTP calls to backend endpoints.
- For example, a function like `getGroups()` fetches a list of groups from the backend.
- The presence of the `GroupsResponse` type/interface suggests structured API responses.

### ⚙️ Request & Response Handling
- The API service functions:
  - Serialize request payloads.
  - Parse server responses (typically JSON).
  - Handle errors (network failures, 4xx/5xx HTTP responses).

---

## 🖥️ Frontend Usage (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)

### 📡 Data Fetching
- When `Dashboard.tsx` mounts, it likely calls API functions like `getGroups()`.
- The returned data is stored in the component’s state.
- This data is then used to render dynamic content.

### 🏗️ State Management & UI Integration
- The response from the backend (formatted as per `GroupsResponse`) helps manage the UI state.
- This enables displaying **groups, statuses, and other backend-driven data** directly in the UI.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)

### 🌍 Environment Variables
- `VITE_BACKEND_URL` (or similar) defines the backend API's base URL.
- This allows the same frontend codebase to function in different environments (**development, staging, production**) without changes.

### 🚀 Build Optimization & Proxying
- Vite can **proxy API requests** during development.
- This setup prevents **CORS issues** by forwarding specific paths to the backend server.

---

## 📑 Data Types & Interfaces

### 🔹 `GroupsResponse`
- This interface defines the structure of **group-related API responses**.
- Ensures type safety in TypeScript, helping frontend components correctly interpret backend data.

---

## ✅ Summary
- Your frontend communicates with the backend via a **structured API service** (`api.ts`).
- **`vite.config.ts`** manages environment settings for smooth API integration.
- API data is **fetched, stored in state, and displayed dynamically** in components like `Dashboard.tsx`.
- TypeScript interfaces like `GroupsResponse` enforce **strong typing**, reducing runtime errors.
