## Functional Requirements

The company aims to develop a **language learning platform** that provides an **interactive and immersive experience** for students.  

There is a strong emphasis on **data privacy**, as the organization is concerned about storing **user data securely** while reducing reliance on **third-party managed AI services**, which may become costly in the long run.  

To achieve this, they plan to **invest in their own AI infrastructure**, specifically **an AI PC** with a budget range of **$10,000 to $15,000**.  

Currently, the platform serves **300 active students**, all of whom are located within the city of **Nagasaki**.  

## Assumptions  

- We assume that the AI-powered **sentence constructor** and **study activities** will significantly improve student engagement and retention.  
- The system will rely on a **local database** (Lang Core 2000 words) while integrating **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** for sentence-building tasks.  
- The company is **prioritizing self-hosted AI solutions** over cloud-based alternatives to **maintain control over operational costs and privacy concerns**.  
- The payment system will be **seamlessly integrated** into the Lang Portal, ensuring **easy access** for students while supporting **teacher involvement** in learning sessions.  

## Considerations  
e
- The AI model should be **self-hosted** to ensure **data privacy** and **cost control**, reducing dependency on third-party cloud services.  

- We need to ensure that the **RAG system** used for **sentence construction** can **retrieve relevant language data efficiently** while maintaining accuracy.  

- The platform must be **scalable** to accommodate more than **300 students** in the future while ensuring smooth performance for existing users.  

- The **payment gateway** should support **local and international transactions** while ensuring compliance with **security standards** like **PCI-DSS**.  

- We need a **monitoring system** to track **AI performance**, detect biases, and ensure that **generated content aligns** with educational objectives.
